# Michele Carlin's Fourth Deliverable

## Merging and reshaping code can be found [HERE](https://dacss-690r.github.io/Third_Deliverable/)

## I merged gender & ethnicity variables into my ClerkshipGrades file matching on ID. ClerkshipGrades file is in long format so students have more than one row of data therefore I used a left join to merge the gender & ethnicity info from one line to many lines in the ClerkshipGrades file.

## I used fuzzy merge to update the location names in the ClerkshipGrades file (see below to see how the locations in the ClerkshipGrades file should be mapped to those in the Locations file).
