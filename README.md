# Michele Carlin's Fourth Deliverable

## Aggregation and exporting code can be found [HERE](https://dacss-690r.github.io/Fourth_Deliverable/)

## I used the ClerkshipGrades file for aggregating as outlined below:

### One group, one input variable, and one function - I grouped the data by Rotation (e.g., Family Medicine Clerkship, Medicine Clerkship, etc.), then used the Final Numeric Score as the input variable, and used Mean as the function.

### Two groups, one input variable, and two functions - I grouped the data by Rotation and Academic Year, using the Final Numeric Score as the input variable, and used Mean and SD as the two functions.

### One group, two input variables, and a different function for each - I grouped the data by Rotation, I used the SPE and NBME numeric scores as the input variables, and then I used Mean/SD as the functions for SPE scores and Min/Max for NBME scores.
